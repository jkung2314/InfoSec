The system performance may be degraded because the image version is not identical, and the ASA may develop a stability issue if the nonidentical image runs for an extended period.   "103008, Number of interfaces on active and standby units in ASA are not same.104001," You have forced the failover pair to switch roles, either by entering the   failover active  command on the standby unit, or the   no failover active  command on the active unit. Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary unit. Possible values for the string variable are as follows:   "104002," You have forced the failover pair to switch roles, either by entering the   failover active  command on the standby unit, or the   no failover active  command on the active unit. Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary unit.

Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary unit.  105020," When a failover occurs, the active ASA detects a partial configuration in memory. Normally, this is caused by an interruption in the replication service. Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary unit.  "105021," During configuration synchronization, a standby unit will reload itself if some other process locks the configuration for more than five minutes, which prevents the failover process from applying the new configuration. This can occur when an administrator pages through a running configuration on the standby unit while configuration synchronization is in process. See also the   show    running-config  command in privileged EXEC mode and the   pager    lines   num  command in global configuration mode in the  Cisco ASA 5500 Series Command Reference .

The unit switches to active mode if it is in standby mode.  105036," The ASA dropped an unacknowledged LAN failover command message, indicating a connectivity problem exists on the LAN failover interface.  "105037," The primary and standby units are switching back and forth as the active unit, indicating a LAN failover connectivity problem or software bug exists.  "105038," When a failover occurs, the active ASA detects a partial configuration in memory. Normally, this is caused by an interruption in the replication service. Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary unit.  "105039, Failover initially verifies that the number of interfaces configured on the primary and secondary ASAs are the same. This message indicates that the primary ASA is not able to verify the number of interfaces configured on the secondary ASA. This message indicates that the primary ASA is not able to communicate with the secondary ASA over the failover interface. Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary unit.  105040, The primary and secondary ASAs should run the same failover software version to act as a failover pair. This message indicates that the secondary ASA failover software version is not compatible with the primary ASA. Failover is disabled on the primary ASA. Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary ASA.  105041, The nameif command replication fails as the number of interfaces is not consistent with mate. 105042, The LAN failover interface link is up.  105043, The LAN failover interface link is down.   105044," When the operational mode (single or multiple) does not match between failover peers, failover will be disabled.  "105045," When the feature licenses do not match between failover peers, failover will be disabled.  "105046," Two failover units have a different type of chassis. For example, one has a three-slot chassis; the other has a six-slot chassis.  "105047, The two failover units have different types of cards in their respective slots.  105048, The failover process detected that different applications are running on the service modules in the active and standby units.

The IP address displayed is the real IP address instead of the IP address that appears through NAT. Possible tcp_flags values correspond to the flags in the TCP header that were present when the connection was denied. For example, a TCP packet arrived for which no connection state exists in the ASA, and it was dropped. The tcp_flags in this packet are FIN and ACK.   "106002," The specified connection failed because of an   outbound    deny  command. The   protocol  variable can be ICMP, TCP, or UDP.  "106006, An inbound UDP packet was denied by the security policy that is defined for the specified traffic type.  106007, A UDP packet containing a DNS query or response was denied.   106010, An inbound connection was denied by your security policy.   106011," The message appears under normal traffic conditions if there are internal users that are accessing the Internet through a web browser. Any time a connection is reset, when the host at the end of the connection sends a packet after the ASA receives the connection reset, this message appears. It can typically be ignored.   "106012," An IP packet was seen with IP options. Because IP options are considered a security risk, the packet was discarded.   "106013, The ASA discarded an inbound ICMP Echo Request packet with a destination address that corresponds to a PAT global address. The inbound packet is discarded because it cannot specify which PAT host should receive the packet.  106014," The ASA denied any inbound ICMP packet access. By default, all ICMP packets are denied access unless specifically allowed.   "106015," The ASA discarded a TCP packet that has no associated connection in the ASA connection table. The ASA looks for a SYN flag in the packet, which indicates a request to establish a new connection. If the SYN flag is not set, and there is no existing connection, the ASA discards the packet.   "106016," A packet arrived at the ASA interface that has a destination IP address of 0.0.0.0 and a destination MAC address of the ASA interface. In addition, this message is generated when the ASA discarded a packet with an invalid source address, which may include one of the following or some other invalid address:  "106017," The ASA received a packet with the IP source address equal to the IP destination, and the destination port equal to the source port. This message indicates a spoofed packet that is designed to attack systems. This attack is referred to as a Land Attack.  "106018, The outgoing ICMP packet with the specified ICMP from local host (inside_address) to the foreign host (outside_address) was denied by the outbound ACL list.  106020, The ASA discarded an IP packet with a teardrop signature containing either a small offset or fragment overlapping. This is a hostile event that circumvents the ASA or an Intrusion Detection System.  106021," An attack is in progress. Someone is attempting to spoof an IP address on an inbound connection. Unicast RPF, also known as reverse route lookup, detected a packet that does not have a source address represented by a route and assumes that it is part of an attack on your ASA.   "106022," A packet matching a connection arrived on a different interface from the interface on which the connection began. In addition, the ip verify reverse-path command is not configured.  "106023," A real IP packet was denied by the ACL. This message appears even if you do not have the   log  option enabled for an ACL. The IP address is the real IP address instead of the values that display through NAT. Both user identity information and FQDN information is provided for the IP addresses if a matched one is found. The ASA logs either identity information (domain\\user) or FQDN (if the username is not available). If the identity information or FQDN is available, the ASA logs this information for both the source and destination.  "106024," The access list compilation process has run out of memory. All configuration information that has been added since the last successful access list was removed from the ASA, and the most recently compiled set of access lists will continue to be used.   "106025, The security context of the packet in multiple context mode cannot be determined. Both messages can be generated for IP packets being dropped in either router and transparent mode.  106026, The security context of the packet in multiple context mode cannot be determined. Both messages can be generated for IP packets being dropped in either router and transparent mode.106027, An non IP packet was denied by the ACL. This message is displayed even if you do not have the log option enabled for an extended ACL.   106100," The initial occurrence or the total number of occurrences during an interval are listed. This message provides more information than message 106023, which only logs denied packets, and does not include the hit count or a configurable level.   "106101," If you configured the   log  option for an ACL   deny  statement ( access-list   id     deny   command), and a traffic flow matches the ACL statement, the ASA caches the flow information. This message indicates that the number of matching flows that are cached on the ASA exceeds the user-configured limit (using the   access-list    deny-flow-max  command). This message might be generated as a result of a DoS attack.  "106102, A packet was either permitted or denied by an access-list that was applied through a VPN filter. This message is the VPN/AAA filter equivalent of message 106100.  106103, A packet was denied by an access-list that was applied through a VPN filter. This message is the VPN/AAA filter equivalent of message106023.  107001, The ASA received a RIP reply message with bad authentication. This message might be caused by a misconfiguration on the router or the ASA or by an unsuccessful attempt to attack the routing table of the ASA.  107002," A router bug, a packet with non-RFC values inside, or a malformed entry may have caused this message to appear. This should not happen, and may be an attempt to exploit the routing table of the ASA.  "108002, A Mail Guard (SMTP) message has been generated by the inspect esmtp command. The ASA has replaced an invalid character in an e-mail address with a space.  108003, The ASA has detected a malicious pattern in an e-mail address and drops the connection. An attack is in progress.  108004," An ESMTP classification is performed on an ESMTP message, and the specified criteria are satisfied. The configured action is taken.  "108005," An ESMTP classification is performed on an ESMTP message, and the specified criteria are satisfied. The standalone log action is taken.  "108006, This event is generated when an ESMTP message size exceeds the size declared in the RCPT command.  108007," On an ESMTP connection, the server has responded with a 220 reply code to the client STARTTLS command. The ESMTP inspection engine no longer inspects the traffic on this connection.  "109001, The ASA is configured for AAA and detects an authentication request by the specified user.  109002, An authentication request failed because the specified authentication server cannot be contacted by the module.  109003, No authentication server can be found.  109005, The specified authentication request succeeded.  109006," The specified authentication request failed, possibly because of an incorrect password. The username is hidden when invalid or unknown, but appears when valid or the   no    logging    hide    username  command has been configured.  "109007, The specified authorization request succeeded.  109008," A user is not authorized to access the specified address, possibly because of an incorrect password.   "109010, An authentication request cannot be processed because the server has too many requests pending.  109011, An authentication session started between the host and the ASA and has not yet completed.  109012, The authentication cache has timed out. Users must reauthenticate on their next connection. You can change the duration of this timer with the timeout uauth command.  109013, The user must be authenticated before using the service.  109014, A request to authenticate did not have a corresponding request for authorization.  109016, The specified on the AAA server for this user does not exist on the ASA. This error can occur if you configure the AAA server before you configure the ASA. The Vendor-Specific Attribute (VSA) on your AAA server might be one of the following values:  109017," A user has exceeded the user authentication proxy limit, and has opened too many connections to the proxy.  "109018, The downloaded authorization has no ACEs. This situation might be caused by misspelling the attribute string  ip:inacl# or omitting the access-list command.  109019," An error occurred during parsing the sequence number NNN in the attribute string ip:inacl#NNN= of a downloaded authorization. The reasons include: - missing = - contains nonnumeric, nonpace characters between # and = - NNN is greater than 999999999.  "109020, One of the components of the downloaded authorization has a configuration error. The entire text of the element is included in the message. This message is usually caused by an invalid access-list command statement.  109021, An internal user authentication error has occurred.  109022,"For each HTTPS authentication, the ASA dedicates a process to service the authentication request. When the number of concurrently running processes exceeds the system-imposed limit, the ASA does not perform the authentication, and this message appears.  "109023," Based on the configured policies, you need to be authenticated before you can use this service port.  "109024, The ASA is configured for AAA and a user attempted to make a TCP connection across the ASA without prior authentication.  109025,"The check failed. The check either matched a deny or did not match anything, such as an implicit deny. The connection was denied by the user acl_ID, which was defined according to the AAA authorization policy on the Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS).  "109026, The response from the AAA server cannot be validated. The configured server key is probably incorrect. This message may be generated during transactions with RADIUS or TACACS+ servers.  109027, The response from the AAA server cannot be validated. The configured server key is probably incorrect. This message may be displayed during transactions with RADIUS or TACACS+ servers. The server_IP_address is the IP address of the relevant AAA server. The user is the user name associated with the connection.  109028,"AAA is being bypassed for same security traffic that matches a configured AAA rule. This can only occur when traffic passes between two interfaces that have the same configured security level, when the same security traffic is permitted, and if the AAA configuration uses the include or exclude syntax.  "109029, A syntax error occurred while parsing an access list that was downloaded from a RADIUS server during user authentication.  109030,A dynamic ACL that is configured on a RADIUS server is not converted by the mechanism for automatically detecting wildcard netmasks. The problem occurs because this mechanism cannot determine if the netmask is a wildcard or a normal netmask.  109031, A user has tried to authenticate to an NT domain that was configured for guest account access and the username is not a valid username on the NT server. The connection is denied.  109032," The ASA received an access control list from a RADIUS server to apply to a user connection, but an entry in the list contains a syntax error. Th euse of a list containing an error could result in the violation of a security policy, so the ASA failed to authenticate the user.  "109033," AAA challenge processing was triggered during authentication of an administrative connection, but the ASA cannot initiate interactive challenge processing with the client application. When this occurs, the authentication attempt will be rejected and the connection denied.  "109034," AAA challenge processing was triggered during authentication of a network connection, but the ASA cannot initiate interactive challenge processing with the client application. When this occurs, the authentication attempt will be rejected and the connection denied.  "109035, This log is generated when the number of DAP attributes received from the RADIUS server exceeds the maximum number allowed when authenticating a connection for the specified user. 109036, The LDAP response message contains an attribute that has more than 1000 values.  109037," The ASA supports multiple values of the same attribute received from a AAA server. If the AAA server sends a response containing more than 5000 values for the same attribute, then the ASA treats this response message as being malformed and rejects the authentication. This condition has only been seen in lab environments using specialized test tools. It is unlikely that the condition would occur in a real-world production network.   "109038, The AAA subsystem tried to parse an attribute from the AAA server into an internal representation and failed.  109039, A packet containing IPv6 addresses or IPv4 addresses translated to IPv6 addresses by NAT requires AAA authentication or authorization. AAA authentication and authorization do not support IPv6 addresses. The packet is dropped.  109040, A connection attempt has been rejected because the ASA has detected a high frequency of HTTPS authentication requests from the same host.  109100," The ASA has successfully processed the CoA policy update request from coa-source-ip for user username with session id audit-session-id . This syslog message is generated after a change of authorization policy update has been received by the ASA, validated and applied. In a non-error case, this is the only syslog message that is generated when a change of authorization is received and processed.  "109101, The ASA has received a correctly formatted Disconnect-Request for an active VPN session and has successfully terminated the connection.  109102," The ASA has received a valid change of authorization request, but the session ID specified in the request does not match any active sessions on the ASA. This could be the result of the change of authorization server attempting to issue a change of authorization on a session that has already been closed by the user.   "109103," The ASA has received a correctly formatted change of authorization request, but was unable to process it successfully.  "109104," The ASA has received a correctly formatted change of authorization request, but did not process it because the indicated action is not supported by the ASA.  "109105," It is necessary for FTD to log a syslog if no routes are present when the interface is BVI. Apparently, if default route is present and it does not route packet to the correct interface then it becomes impossible to track it. In case of FTD, management routes are looked first following the data interface. So if default route is routing packets to different destination, then it is difficult to track it. "110002, An error occurred when the ASA tried to find the interface through which to send the packet.   110003, An error occurred when the ASA tried to find the next hop on an interface routing table.  110004, A flow changed on the egress interface.  111001," You have entered the   write  command to store your configuration on a device (either floppy, flash memory, TFTP, the failover standby unit, or the console terminal). The   IP_address  indicates whether the login was made at the console port or with a Telnet connection.  "111002," You have entered the   read   command to read your configuration from a device (either floppy disk, flash memory, TFTP, the failover standby unit, or the console terminal). The   IP_address  indicates whether the login was made at the console port or with a Telnet connection.

The device text can be floppy, memory, net, standby, or terminal. The   IP_address  value indicates whether the login was made at the console port or through a Telnet connection.  "111008," The user entered any command, with the exception of a   show  command.  "111009, The user entered a command that does not modify the configuration. This message appears only for   show  commands.  111010, A user made a configuration change.  111111, A system or infrastructure error has occurred.  112001, A request to clear the module configuration was completed. The source file and line number are identified.  113001, The AAA operation on an IPsec tunnel or WebVPN connection cannot be performed because of the unavailability of AAA resources. The   limit  value indicates the maximum number of concurrent AAA transactions.  113003," The group policy that is associated with the tunnel group is being overridden with a user-specific policy,  policy_name . The  policy_name is specified using the   username  command when LOCAL authentication is configured or is returned in the RADIUS CLASS attribute when RADIUS authentication is configured.  "113004," The AAA operation on an IPsec or WebVPN connection has been completed successfully. The AAA types are authentication, authorization, or accounting. The   server_IP_address  is the IP address of the relevant AAA server. The   user  is the user name associated with the connection.  "113005," The AAA authentication on a connection has failed.

"304007," You used the allow option of the filter command, and the Websense servers are not responding. The ASA allows all web requests to continue without filtering while the servers are not available.  "304008," You used the allow option of the filter command, and the ASA receives a response message from a Websense server that previously was not responding. With this response message, the ASA exits the allow mode, which enables the URL filtering feature again.  "304009, The URL pending buffer block is running out of space.   305005," A packet does not match any of the outbound nat command rules. If NAT is not configured for the specified source and destination systems, the message will be generated frequently.  "305006," A protocol (UDP, TCP, or ICMP) failed to create a translation through the ASA. The ASA does not allow packets through that are destined for network or broadcast addresses. The ASA provides this checking for addresses that are explicitly identified with static commands. For inbound traffic, the ASA denies translations for an IP address identified as a network or broadcast address.   "305007, The ASA has attempted to translate an address that it cannot find in any of its global pools. The ASA assumes that the address was deleted and drops the request.  305008," The ASA kernel detected an inconsistency condition when trying to free an unallocated global IP address back to the address pool. This abnormal condition may occur if the ASA is running a Stateful Failover setup, and some of the internal states are momentarily out of sync between the active unit and the standby unit. This condition is not catastrophic, and the synchronization recovers automatically.  "305009," An address translation slot was created. The slot translates the source address from the local side to the global side. In reverse, the slot translates the destination address from the global side to the local side.  "305010, The address translation slot was deleted.  305011," A TCP, UDP, or ICMP address translation slot was created. The slot translates the source socket from the local side to the global side. In reverse, the slot translates the destination socket from the global side to the local side.

Another RIP device may not be configured correctly to communicate with the ASA.  "313001," When using the icmp command with an access list, if the first matched entry is a permit entry, the ICMP packet continues processing. If the first matched entry is a deny entry, or an entry is not matched, the ASA discards the ICMP packet and generates this message. The   icmp  command enables or disables pinging to an interface. With pinging disabled, the ASA cannot be detected on the network. This feature is also referred to as configurable proxy pinging.  "313004," ICMP packets were dropped by the ASA because of security checks added by the stateful ICMP feature that are usually either ICMP echo replies without a valid echo request already passed across the ASA or ICMP error messages not related to any TCP, UDP, or ICMP session already established in the ASA.  "313005, ICMP error packets were dropped by the ASA because the ICMP error messages are not related to any session already established in the ASA.  313008," When using the   icmp  command with an access list, if the first matched entry is a permit entry, the ICMPv6 packet continues processing. If the first matched entry is a deny entry, or an entry is not matched, the ASA discards the ICMPv6 packet and generates this message.   "313009, An ICMP echo request/reply packet was received with a malformed code(non-zero).  314001, The ASA opened a UDP media channel for the RTSP client that was receiving data from the server.  314002, The ASA cannot open a new pinhole for the media channel.  314003," The RTSP message violated the user-configured RTSP security policy, either because it contains a port from the reserve port range, or it contains a URL with a length greater than the maximum limit allowed.  "314004, An RTSP client tried to access an RTSP server.  314005, An RTSP client tried to access a prohibited site.  314006, A specific RTSP request message exceeded the configured rate limit of RTSP policy.  315004," The ASA cannot find the RSA host key, which is required for establishing an SSH session. The ASA host key may be absent because it was not generated or because the license for this ASA does not allow DES or 3DES encryption.  "315011," An SSH session has ended. If a user enters   quit  or   exit , the   terminated   normally  message appears. The username is hidden when invalid or unknown, but appears when valid or the   no logging   hide username  command has been configured. If the session disconnected for another reason, the text describes the reason. The following table lists the possible reasons why a session is disconnected.   "315012,"  As part of the FIPS 140-2 certification, when FIPS is enabled, SSH connections can only be brought up using aes128-cbc or aes256-cbc as the cipher and SHA1 as the MAC. This syslog is generated when an unacceptable cipher or MAC is used. This syslog will not be seen if FIPS mode is disabled."315013, This syslog is needed to indicate that an SSH rekey has successfully completed. This is a Common Criteria certification requirement.  316001," If more VPN tunnels (ISAKMP/IPsec) are concurrently trying to be established than are supported by the platform VPN peer limit, then the excess tunnels are aborted.  "316002," The ASA cannot create a VPN handle, because the VPN handle already exists.  "317001, The requested operation failed because of a low-memory condition.  317002, A software error occurred.  317003," An internal software error occurred, which prevented the creation of a new IP routing table.

This action will bring down all virtual links.  "318009," OSPF is running and has tried to reference some related data structures that have been removed elsewhere. Clearing interface and router configurations may resolve the problem. However, if this message appears, some sequence of steps caused premature deletion of data structures and this needs to be investigated.   "318101, An internal software error has occurred.  318102, The router was flagged as an Area Border Router (ABR) without a backbone area in the router.  318103, An internal software error has occurred.  318104," OSPF has a problem locating the LSA, which could lead to a memory leak.

Possible reasons include the following:   318126, The interface is on the interface list for an area other than the one to which the interface links.  318127, An internal error has occurred.  319001, The ARP process in the ASA lost internal synchronization because the ASA was overloaded.  319002, The routing module in the ASA lost internal synchronization because the ASA was overloaded.  319003," When an ARP entry has to be updated, a message is sent to the network processor (NP) in order to update the internal ARP table. If the module is experiencing high utilization of memory or if the internal table is full, the message to the NP may be rejected and this message generated.  "319004, The routing module in the ASA lost internal synchronization because the system was overloaded.  320001," When the ASA is an easy VPN remote device or server, the peer certificate includes asubject name that does not match the output of the   ca    verifycertdn   command. A man-in-the-middle attack might be occurring, where a device spoofs the peer IP address and tries to intercept a VPN connection from the ASA.  "321001, A configured resource usage or rate limit for the indicated resource was reached.  321002, A configured resource usage or rate limit for the indicated resource was reached.  321003, A configured resource usage or rate logging level for the indicated resource was reached.  321004, A configured resource usage or rate logging level for the indicated resource was reached.  321005, The system CPU utilization has reached 95 percent or more and remains at this level for five minutes.  321006, The system memory usage has reached 80 percent or more and remains at this level for five minutes.  321007, The system is low on free blocks of memory. Running out of blocks may result in traffic disruption.  322001," The ASA received a packet from the offending MAC address on the specified interface, but the source MAC address in the packet is statically bound to another interface in the configuration. Either a MAC-spoofing attack or a misconfiguration may be the cause.  "322002," If the ARP inspection module is enabled, it checks whether a new ARP entry advertised in the packet conforms to the statically configured or dynamically learned IP-MAC address binding before forwarding ARP packets across the ASA. If this check fails, the ARP inspection module drops the ARP packet and generates this message. This situation may be caused by either ARP spoofing attacks in the network or an invalid configuration (IP-MAC binding).  "322003," If the ARP inspection module is enabled, it checks whether a new ARP entry advertised in the packet conforms to the statically configured IP-MAC address binding before forwarding ARP packets across the ASA. If this check fails, the ARP inspection module drops the ARP packet and generates this message. This situation may be caused by either ARP spoofing attacks in the network or an invalid configuration (IP-MAC binding).  "322004, The ASA dropped a packet because no management IP address was configured in the transparent mode.   323001, The ASA is unable to communicate via control channel with the module installed (in the specified slot).  323002, The module installed did not respond to a shutdown request.  323003, The module installed did not respond to a reload request.  323004," The module failed to accept a software version, and will be transitioned to an UNRESPONSIVE state. The module is not usable until the software is updated.   "323005, This message indicates that the module can not be started completely. The module will remain in the UNRESPONSIVE state until this condition is corrected. A module that is not fully seated in the slot is the most likely cause.   323006," A data channel communication failure occurred and the ASA was unable to forward traffic to the services module. This failure triggers a failover when the failure occurs on the active ASA in an HA configuration. The failure also results in the configured fail open or fail closed policy being enforced on traffic that would normally be sent to the services module. This message is generated whenever a communication problem over the ASA dataplane occurs between the system module and the services module, which can be caused when the services module stops, resets, is removed or disabled.  "323007," An ASA with a 4GE-SSM installed experienced a short power surge, then rebooted. As a result, the 4GE-SSM may come online in an unresponsive state. The ASA has detected that the 4GE-SSM is unresponsive, and automatically restarts the 4GE-SSM.  "324000, The packet being processed did not meet the filtering requirements as described in the   reason  variable and is being dropped.  324001, There was an error processing the packet. The following are possible reasons:  324002," If this message was preceded by message 321100, memory allocation error, the message indicates that there were not enough resources to create the PDP context. If not, it was not preceded by message 321100. For version 0, it indicates that the corresponding PDP context cannot be found. For version 1, if this message was preceded by message 324001, then a packet processing error occurred, and the operation stopped.   "324003, The response received does not have a matching request in the request queue and should not be processed further.  324004," The packet being processed has a version other than the currently supported version, which is 0 or 1. If the version number printed out is an incorrect number and is seen frequently, then the endpoint may be sending out bad packets as part of an attack.   "324005, An error occurred while trying to create the tunnel for the transport protocol data units.  324006," The GPRS support node sending the request has exceeded the maximum allowed tunnels created, so no tunnel will be created.

"401005,The ASA is out of memory; a shun cannot be applied.  402114,"An IPsec packet was received that specifies an SPI that does not exist in the SA database. This may be a temporary condition caused by slight differences in aging of SAs between the IPsec peers, or it may be because the local SAs have been cleared. It may also indicate incorrect packets sent by the IPsec peer, which may be part of an attack. This message is rate limited to no more than one message every five seconds.  "402115," An IPsec packet was received that is missing the expected ESP header. The peer is sending packets that do not match the negotiated security policy, which may indicate an attack. This message is rate limited to no more than one message every five seconds.  "402116,"A decapsulated IPsec packet does not match the negotiated identity. The peer is sending other traffic through this security association, which may be caused by a security association selection error by the peer, or it may be part of an attack. This message is rate limited to no more than one message every five seconds.  "402117,"The received packet matched the crypto map ACL, but it is not IPsec-encapsulated. The IPsec peer is sending unencapsulated packets. This error can occur because of a policy setup error on the peer. For example, the firewall may be configured to only accept encrypted Telnet traffic to the outside interface port 23. If you attempt to use Telnet without IPsec encryption to access the outside interface on port 23, this message appears, but not with Telnet or traffic to the outside interface on ports other than 23. This error can also indicate an attack. This message is not generated except under these conditions (for example, it is not generated for traffic to the ASA interfaces themselves).

The information from this message captures the details to allow further analysis of the problem. The crypto chip is reset when this condition is detected to unobtrusively allow the ASA to continue functioning. Also, the crypto environment at the time this issue is detected is written to a crypto archive directory on flash to provide further debugging information. Various parameters related to the crypto hardware are included in this message, as follows:  "402125,"  The crypto driver has detected that either the IPSEC descriptor ring or SSL/Admin descriptor ring is no longer progressing, meaning the crypto chip no longer appears to be functioning. The crypto chip is reset when this condition is detected to unobtrusively allow the ASA to continue functioning. Also, the crypto environment at the time this issue was detected was written to a crypto archive directory on flash to provide further debugging information.  "402126,"   A functional problem with the hardware crypto chip was detected (see syslog messages 402124 and 402125). To further debug the crypto problem, a crypto archive file was generated that included the current crypto hardware environment (hardware registers and crypto description entries). At boot time, a crypto_archive directory was automatically created on the flash file system (if it did not exist previously). A maximum of two crypto archive files are allowed to exist in this directory.   "402127,"  A functional problem with the hardware crypto chip was detected (see messages 4402124 and 4402125). This message indicates a crypto archive file was not written, because the maximum number of crypto archive files already existed.  "402128,   An SSL connection is attempting to use more memory than allowed. The request has been denied.  402129,   An internal software error has occurred.  402130,  The ASA crypto hardware accelerator detected an IPsec packet with invalid padding.

The response from the service provider includes other services, but does not include the service  any . This is a discrepancy in the implementation of the protocol. The PADO packet is processed normally, and connection negotiations continue.  "403501,"  The ASA sent an identifier called the host-unique value to the access controller. The access controller responded with a different host-unique value. The ASA was unable to identify the corresponding connection request for this response. The packet was dropped, and connection negotiations were discontinued.  "403502,"  The ASA sent an identifier called the host-unique value to the access controller. The access controller responded with a different host-unique value. The ASA was unable to identify the corresponding connection request for this response. The packet was dropped, and connection negotiations were discontinued.  "403503,   The PPP link has gone down. There are many reasons why this can happen. The first format will display a reason if PPP provides one.  403504,"   PPPoE requires a dial-out configuration before starting a PPPoE session. In general, the configuration should specify a dialing policy, the PPP authentication, the username, and a password. The following example configures the ASA for PPPoE dialout. The my-username and my-password commands are used to authenticate the access concentrator, using PAP if necessary.  "403505,"  This message is usually followed by the message, default route already exists.  "403506,"  This message is followed by one of the followings messages: subnet is the same as interface, or on failover channel.  "403507,"  You can configure the PPPoE client on an interface to use a particular VPDN group by entering the   pppoe    client   vpdn    group   group_name  command. If a PPPoE VPDN group of the configured name was not located during system startup, this message is generated.  "405001,"  The ASA received an ARP packet, and the MAC address in the packet differs from the ARP cache entry.  "405002,  This packet appears for one of the following conditions:  405003,  A client IP address in the network is the same as the ASA interface IP address.  405101,  The module failed to allocate RAM system memory while starting a connection or has no more address translation slots available.  405102,   The ASA failed to allocate RAM system memory while starting a connection or has no more address translation slots available.  405103,"  The ASA is expecting the protocol discriminator, 0x08, but it received something other than 0x08. The endpoint may be sending a bad packet, or received a message segment other than the first segment. The packet is allowed through.  "405104,"   An H.225 message was received out of order, before the initial SETUP message, which is not allowed. The ASA must receive an initial SETUP message for that H.225 call signalling channel before accepting any other H.225 messages.  "405105,"   A gatekeeper has sent an ACF, but the ASA did not send an ARQ to the gatekeeper.   "405106,  The ASA tried to create a match condition on the H.323 media-type channel. See the   match    media-type  command for more information.  405107,  An H.323 connection has been dropped because of an attempted H.245 tunnel control during call setup. See the   h245-tunnel-block  command for more information.  405201,  The embedded address in the ILS packet payload was not the same as the source IP address of the IP packet header.   405300,  The accounting request came from a host that was not configured in the policy map. The message is logged and processing stops.  405301,"  When the   validate-attribute  command was entered, the attribute values stored in the accounting request start received do not match those stored in the entry, if it exists.  "406001,"  A client entered an FTP port command and supplied a port less than 1024 (in the well-known port range usually devoted to server ports). This is indicative of an attempt to avert the site security policy. The ASA drops the packet, terminates the connection, and logs the event.  "406002,"   A client entered an FTP port command and supplied an address other than the address used in the connection. An attempt to avert the site security policy occurred. For example, an attacker might attempt to hijack an FTP session by changing the packet on the way, and putting different source information instead of the correct source information. The ASA drops the packet, terminates the connection, and logs the event. The address in parentheses is the address from the port command.   "407001,   The host limit was exceeded. An inside host is counted toward the limit when one of the following conditions is true:   407002,"  The number of connections from a specified foreign address over a specified global address to the specified local address exceeded the maximum embryonic limit for that static. The ASA tries to accept the connection if it can allocate memory for that connection. It proxies on behalf of the local host and sends a SYN_ACK packet to the foreign host. The ASA retains pertinent state information, drops the packet, and waits for the acknowledgment from the client. The message might indicate legitimate traffic or that a DoS attack is in progress.   "407003,   The ASA tried to open a new hole for a pair of RPC servers or services that have already been configured after the maximum number of holes has been met.   408001,  An attempt to decrement the IP route counter into a negative value failed.  408002,"   A network update was received from a different interface with the same distance and a better metric than the existing route. The new route overrides the existing route that was installed through another interface. The new route is for redundancy purposes only and means that a path has shifted in the network. This change must be controlled through topology and redistribution. Any existing connections affected by this change are probably disabled and will time out. This path shift only occurs if the network topology has been specifically designed to support path redundancy, in which case it is expected.  "408003,   A component of the tracking system has encountered an object type that is not supported by the component. A STATE object was expected.  409001,  The software detected an unexpected condition.

These options are only allowed on NBMA type networks.  409128,"The router indicated in this message has originated an LSA with an invalid metric. If this is a router LSA and the link metric is zero, a risk of routing loops and traffic loss exists in the network.  "410001," The domain-name length exceeds 255 bytes in a UDP DNS packet. See RFC 1035, Section 3.1 for more information.  "410002,  The ASA detects an excess number of DNS responses with a mismatched DNS identifier. A high rate of mismatched DNS identifiers might indicate an attack on the cache. The threshold is set by the   id-mismatch  DNS policy-map parameter submode command.   410003,"  A DNS classification was performed on a DNS message and the specified criteria were satisfied. As a result, the configured action occurs.

"411003,  The configuration status of the interface has changed from down to up.  411004,  The configuration status of the interface has changed from down to up.  411005,"   The interface experienced a hardware transmit freeze that required a reset of the Ethernet controller to restore the interface to full operation. This is a known issue with Gigabit interfaces on ASA 5510, ASA 5520, ASA 5540, and ASA 5550 ASAs.  "412001,"   A host move was detected from one module interface to another. In a transparent ASA, mapping between the host (MAC) and ASA port is maintained in a Layer 2 forwarding table. The table dynamically binds packet source MAC addresses to an ASA port. In this process, whenever movement of a host from one interface to another interface is detected, this message is generated.  "412002,"  The bridge table was full and an attempt was made to add one more entry. The ASA maintains a separate Layer 2 forwarding table per context and the message is generated whenever a context exceeds its size limit. The MAC address will be added, but it will replace the oldest existing dynamic entry (if available) in the table. This might be an attempted attack.   "413001,"   The module identified by module_id was not able to comply with a request from the ASA system module to shut down.

This list overrides any backup servers that you have configured locally. If the downloaded list is empty, then the ASA uses no backup servers. The   reason  is one of the following messages:  "611313,"  When the ASA is an Easy VPN remote device, and the Easy VPN server downloads a backup server list to the ASA, the list includes an invalid IP address or a hostname. The ASA does not support DNS, and therefore does not support hostnames for servers, unless you manually map a name to an IP address using the   name  command.  "611314,"  When the ASA is an Easy VPN remote device, the master server of the load balancing cluster redirected the ASA to connect to a particular server.

"611320,"   When the ASA is an Easy VPN remote device, the downloaded VPN policy enabled device pass-through. The device pass-through feature allows devices that cannot perform authentication (such as an IP phone) to be exempt from authentication when IUA is enabled. If the Easy VPN server enabled this feature, you can specify the devices that should be exempt from authentication (IUA) using the   vpnclient    mac-exempt  command on the ASA.  "611321,"   When the ASA is an Easy VPN remote device, the downloaded VPN policy disabled device pass-through.  "611322,"  When the ASA is an Easy VPN remote device and the downloaded VPN policy disabled SUA, the Easy VPN server uses two-factor/SecurID/cryptocard-based authentication mechansims to authenticate the ASA using XAUTH.  "611323,"  When the ASA is an Easy VPN remote device, the downloaded VPN policy included duplicate split network entries. An entry is considered a duplicate if it matches both the network address and the network mask.  "612001,"  An update from an Auto Update server was successful.

Primary can also be listed as Secondary for the secondary unit.  709007,   A failover message that appears when the standby unit is unable to complete replication of a configuration sent by the active unit. The command that caused the failure appears at the end of the message.  709008,"  A command was issued during the configuration sync, which triggered an interactive prompt to indicate that this command would not be issued on the standby unit. To continue, note that the command will be issued on the active unit only and will not be replicated on the standby unit.  "710001,"   The first TCP packet destined to the ASA requests to establish a TCP session. This packet is the first SYN packet of the three-way handshake. This message appears when the respective (Telnet, HTTP, or SSH) has permitted the packet. However, the SYN cookie verification is not yet completed and no state is reserved.  "710002,"   For a TCP connection, the second TCP packet destined for the ASA requested to establish a TCP session. This packet is the final ACK of the three-way handshake. The respective (Telnet, HTTP, or SSH) has permitted the packet. Also, the SYN cookie verification was successful and the state is reserved for the TCP session.   "710003,"  The ASA denied an attempt to connect to the interface service. For example, the ASA received an SNMP request from an unauthorized SNMP management station. If this message appears frequently, it can indicate an attack.   "710004,"  The maximum number of ASA management connections for the service was exceeded. The ASA permits at most five concurrent management connections per management service. Alternatively, an error may have occurred in the to-the-box connection counter.  "710005,"  The ASA does not have a UDP server that services the UDP request. Also, a TCP packet that does not belong to any session on the ASA may have been discarded. In addition, this message appears (with the SNMP   service) when the ASA receives an SNMP request with an empty payload, even if it is from an authorized host. When the service is SNMP, this message occurs a maximum of once every 10 seconds so that the log receiver is not overwhelmed.  "710006,"   The ASA does not have an IP server that services the IP protocol request; for example, the ASA receives IP packets that are not TCP or UDP, and the ASA cannot service the request.

This message is used for debugging CPU purposes, and can appear once every five seconds for each offending process.  "711003,"  An internal inconsistency that should not occur during normal operation has occurred. However, this message is not harmful if it rarely occurs. If it occurs frequently, it might be worthwhile debugging.  "711004,"  A process used the CPU for more than 100 milliseconds. This message is used for debugging CPU purposes, and can appear once every five seconds for each offending process.  "711005,"  An internal software error that should not occur has occurred. The device can usually recover from this error, and no harmful effect to the device results.  "711006,   CPU profiling has started.  713004,"   The ASA has received an IKE packet from a remote entity trying to initiate a tunnel. Because the ASA is scheduled for a reboot or shutdown, it does not allow any more tunnels to be established. The IKE packet is ignored and dropped.  "713201,"   The ASA has received a duplicate of a previous Phase 1 or Phase 2 packet, and will transmit the last message. A network performance or connectivity issue may have occurred, in which the peer is not receiving sent packets in a timely manner.  "713202,"  The ASA has received a duplicate first packet for a tunnel that the ASA is already aware of and negotiating, which indicates that the ASA probably received a retransmission of a packet from the peer.  "713006,"  The ASA does not know about the received message ID. The message ID is used to identify a specific IKE Phase 2 negotiation. An error condition on the ASA may have occurred, and may indicate that the two IKE peers are out-of-sync.  "713008,"  A key ID value was received in the ID payload, which was longer than the maximum allowed size of a group name for this IKE session using preshared keys authentication. This is an invalid value, and the session is rejected. Note that the key ID specified would never work because a group name of that size cannot be created in the ASA.   "713009,"   An OU value in the DN was received in the ID payload, which was longer than the maximum allowed size of a group name for this IKE session using Certs authentication. This OU is skipped, and another OU or other criteria may find a matching group.  "713010," An attempt was made to locate a conn_entry (IKE phase 2 structure that corresponds to an IPsec SA) using the unique message ID, which failed. The internal structure was not found, which may occur if a session was terminated in a nonstandard way, but it is more likely that an internal error occurred."713012,  An illegal or unsupported IPsec protocol has been received from the peer.  713014,  The ISAKMP DOI received from the peer is unsupported.  713016,  The ID received from the peer is unknown. The ID can be an unfamiliar valid ID or an invalid or corrupted ID.  713017,"   The Phase 1 or Phase 2 ID received from the peer is legal, but not supported.  "713018,  Tn internal software error has occurred.  713020,   Tn internal software error has occurred.  713022,   group exists in the group database with the same name as the value (key ID or IP address) specified by the peer.  713024,   The ASA has received the Phase 2 local proxy ID payload from the remote peer.  713025,   The ASA has received the Phase 2 local proxy ID payload from the remote peer.  713028,"   The ASA has received the Phase 2 local proxy ID payload of the remote peer, which includes an IP address range.  "713029,"   The ASA has received the Phase 2 local proxy ID payload of the remote peer, which includes an IP address range.  "713032,"   The local ID payload included the range ID type, and the specified low address was not less than the high address. A configuration problem may exist.  "713033,"  The remote ID payload included the range ID type, and the specified low address was not less than the high address. A configuration problem may exist.  "713034,  The local IP proxy subnet data has been received in the Phase 2 ID payload.  713035,  The remote IP proxy subnet data has been received in the Phase 2 ID payload.  713039,"  An internal software error has occurred, and the ISAKMP packet cannot be transmitted.  "713040,"   An internal software error has occurred, and a Phase 2 data structure cannot be found.  "713041,   ASA is negotiating a tunnel as the initiator.  713042,"  The IPsec fast path processed a packet that triggered IKE, but the IKE policy lookup failed. This error may be timing related. The ACLs that triggered IKE might have been deleted before IKE processed the initiation request. This problem will most likely correct itself.  "713043,  IKE has been triggered again while the original tunnel is in progress.  713048,  A packet has been received with a payload that cannot be processed.  713049,  An IPsec tunnel has been started.  713050,   An IPsec tunnel has been terminated. Possible termination reasons include:  713052,   remote access user was authenticated.  713056,  The IPsec SA was not found.   713060,   The user is configured for a different group than what was sent in the IPsec negotiation.   713061,  The ASA was not able to find security policy information for the private networks or hosts indicated in the message. These networks or hosts were sent by the initiator and do not match any crypto ACLs at the ASA. This is most likely a misconfiguration.  713062,  The IP address configured as the IKE peer is the same as the IP address configured on one of the ASA IP interfaces.  713063,  The IKE peer address is not configured for an L2L tunnel.  713065,   An internal software error has occurred.  713066,  The crypto policy settings of the peer have been configured.  713068,  Notification messages that caused this event are not explicitly handled in the notify processing code.   713072,  The password of the user is too long.  713073,   Rekeying durations are always set to the lower of the values proposed by IKE peers. The value of the initiator is the lower one.  713074,   Rekeying durations are always set to the lower of the values proposed by IKE peers. The value of the initiator is the lower one.  713075,   Rekeying durations are always set to the lower of the values proposed by IKE peers. The value of the responder is the lower one.  713076,   Rekeying durations are always set to the lower of the values proposed by IKE peers. The value of the responder is the lower one.  713078,   An internal software error has occurred while processing modecfg attributes.  713081,"  One of the loaded certificates is unreadable, and may be an unsupported encoding scheme.  "713082,   The identity certificate for this tunnel cannot be found.  713083,  The identity certificate for this tunnel cannot be found.  713084,  The port value received in the IKE phase 1 ID payload was incorrect. Acceptable values are 0 or 500 (ISAKMP is also known as IKE).  713085,   The protocol value received in the IKE phase 1 ID payload was incorrect. Acceptable values are 0 or 17 (UDP).  713086,"   A certificate payload was received, but our internal certificate handle indicates that we do not have an identity certificate. The certificate handle was not obtained through a normal enrollment method. One likely reason this can happen is that the authentication method is not made through RSA or DSS signatures, although the IKE SA negotiation should fail if each side is misconfigured.   "713088,"   The tunnel group cannot be found, based on the digital certificate information.   "713092,  An internal software error has occurred. This is often a benign event.   713094,  An internal software error has occurred.  713098,"   An attempt was made to establish a certificate-based IKE session, but no identity certificate has been specified in the crypto policy.   "713099,  An internal software error has occurred.  713102,   IKE has received an ID payload that includes an identification data field of 2 K or larger.   713103,   An internal software error has occurred.  713104,  An internal software error has occurred.  713105,"  A peer sent an ID payload without including any ID data, which is invalid.   "713107,   An internal software error has occurred.  713109,"  The ASA was unable to process the certificate received from the remote peer, which can occur if the certificate data was malformed (for example, if the public key size is larger than 4096 bits) or if the data in the certificate cannot be stored by the ASA.   "713112,"  The ASA was unable to successfully process the notification payload that included the CONNECTED notify type. This may occur if the IKE phase 2 structure cannot be found using the SPI to locate it, or the commit bit had not been set in the received ISAKMP header. The latter case may indicate a nonconforming IKE peer.  "713113,"  An IKE SA is being deleted with a nonzero tunnel count, which means that either the IKE SA tunnel count has lost synchronization with the associated connection entries or the associated connection cookie fields for the entries have lost synchronization with the cookie fields of the IKE SA to which the connection entry points. If this occurs, the IKE SA and its associated data structures will not be freed, so that the entries that may point to it will not have a stale pointer.  "713114,  An internal software error has occurred.  713115,"   The client rejected an attempt by the ASA to use IPsec over UDP. IPsec over UDP is used to allow multiple clients to establish simultaneous tunnels to the ASA through a NAT device. The client may have rejected the request, either because it does not support this feature or because it is configured not to use it.  "713117,"   The IPsec SA identified by the SPI value is no longer active on the remote peer, which might indicate that the remote peer has rebooted or been reset.  "713118,"   The   group_descriptor  field included an unsupported value. Currently we support only groups 1, 2, 5, and 7. In the case of a centry, the   group_descriptor  field may also be set to 0 to indicate that perfect forward secrecy is disabled.  "713119,   IKE Phase 1 has completed successfully.  713120,   IKE Phase 2 has completed successfully.  713121,   The type of keepalive mechanism that is being used for this tunnel is specified.  713122,"  Keepalives were configured on or off for this device, but the IKE peer does or does not support keepalives.   "713123,"   The remote IKE peer did not respond to keepalives within the expected window of time, so the connection to the IKE peer was terminated. The message includes the keepalive mechanism used.  "713124,   The remote IKE peer sent a DPD with a sequence number that did not match the expected sequence number. The packet is discarded. This might indicate a packet loss problem with the network.  713127,"  The peer wanted to perform a XAUTH, but the ASA did not choose the XAUTH IKE proposal.  "713128,  A connection attempt has been made to the VCPIP and has been redirected to a less loaded peer using load balancing.  713129,"  An unexpected payload has been received during XAUTH or Mode Cfg, which may indicate that the two peers are out-of-sync, that the XAUTH or Mode Cfg versions do not match, or that the remote peer is not complying with the appropriate RFCs.  "713130,   The device received a request for a valid transaction mode attribute (XAUTH or Mode Cfg) that is currently not supported. This is generally a benign condition.  713131,"   The ASA has received a request for a transaction mode attribute (XAUTH or Mode Cfg) that is outside the range of known attributes. The attribute may be valid but only supported in later versions of configuration mode, or the peer may be sending an illegal or proprietary value. This should not cause connectivity problems, but may affect the functionality of the peer.  "713132,   A request for an IP address for a remote access client from the internal utility that provides these addresses cannot be satisfied.   713133,   The configured Phase 2 PFS Group differed from the DH group that was negotiated for Phase 1.   713134,"   The configured LAN-to-LAN proposal is different from the one accepted for the LAN-to-LAN connection. Depending on which side is the initiator, different proposals will be used.  "713135,  The tunnel is being redirected because of load balancing on the remote ASA. A REDIRECT_CONNECTION notify packet was received.  713136,  The Reaper has detected an ASA stuck in an inactive state. The Reaper will try to remove the inactive ASA.  713137,   An internal software error has occurred.  713138,"  No group exists in the group database with the same name as the IP address of the peer. In Main Mode, the ASA will fall back and try to use the default preshared key configured in one of the default groups. The default preshared key is not configured.  "713139,"  No tunnel group exists in the group database with the same name as the IP address of the peer. In Main Mode, the ASA will fall back and use the default preshared key configured in the default group.  "713140,   The split tunneling policy is set to either split tunneling or to allow local LAN access. A split tunneling ACL must be defined to represent the information required by the VPN client.  713141,"  The ASA installed on the client does not match the configured required ASA. This message lists the actual and expected values, and whether the tunnel is terminated or allowed.  "713142,"  The client did not report an ASA in use using ModeCfg, but one is required. The event lists the expected values and whether the tunnel is terminated or allowed. Note that the number following the product string is a bitmask of all of the allowed products.  "713143,  Debugging information about the ASA installed on the client appears.  713144,  Bad ASA information was received from the client.  713145,"   A tunnel with a hardware client in network extension mode has been negotiated, and a static route is being added for the private network behind the hardware client. This configuration enables the ASA to make the remote network known to all the routers on the private side of the headend.  "713146,"  An internal software error has occurred. A tunnel with a hardware client in network extension mode has been negotiated, and an attempt to add the static route for the private network behind the hardware client failed. The routing table may be full, or a possible addressing error has occurred.  "713147,"  A tunnel to a hardware client in network extension mode is being removed, and the static route for the private network is being deleted behind the hardware client.  "713148,"  While a tunnel to a hardware client in network extension mode was being removed, a route to the private network behind the hardware client cannot be deleted. This might indicate an addressing or software problem.   "713149,"  The headend ASA has the specified hardware client security attribute enabled, but the attribute was not requested by the VPN 3002 hardware client.  "713152,"  The client is required to use CPP to provision its ASA, but the headend device was unable to obtain any ACLs to send to the client. This is probably due to a misconfiguration.  "713154,  This message appears when a DNS lookup for the specified server has not been resolved.  713155,  A previous DNS lookup failure for the primary server might have caused the ASA to initialize a backup peer. This message indicates that a later DNS lookup on the primary server finally succeeded and is resetting any backup server initializations. A tunnel initiated after this point will be aimed at the primary server.  713156,"  The client is failing over to a backup server, or a failed DNS lookup for the primary server caused the ASA to initialize a backup server. A tunnel initiated after this point will be aimed at the specified backup server.  "713157,"  The client tried to initiate a tunnel by sending out IKE MSG1, but did not receive a response from the ASA on the other end. If backup servers are available, the client will attempt to connect to one of them.  "713158,   The client is configured to use IPsec over TCP. The client rejected the attempt by the ASA to use IPsec over UDP.  713159,"   The TCP connection to the ASA server was lost for a certain reason, such as the server has rebooted, a network problem has occurred, or an SSL mismatch has occurred.  "713160,  Normal authentication of the remote user to the ASA server has occurred.  713161,"  The ASA server has sent the ASA a message indicating that this user must be restricted. There are several reasons for this, including ASA software upgrades or changes in permissions. The ASA server will transition the user back into full access mode as soon as the operation has been completed.  "713162,   The ASA server has rejected this user.  713163,"   The ASA server has terminated this user session, which can occur if the integrity agent stops running on the client machine or if the security policy is modified by the remote user in any way.  "713164,  The ASA server will request the session information if it detects that it has stale data or if it loses the session data (because of a reboot).  713165,  The client negotiated with preshared keys while its tunnel group points to a policy that is configured to use digital certificates.  713166,  The hardware client has failed extended authentication. This is most likely a username and password problem or an authentication server issue.  713167,"  The remote user has failed to extend authentication. This is most likely a username or password problem, or an authentication server issue.  "713168,"  Reauthentication on rekeying has been enabled, but the tunnel authentication requires manual intervention.  "713169,   IKE has received a delete message from the remote peer to delete its old IKE SA after a rekey has completed.  713170,   IKE has received a delete message from the remote peer to delete its old centry after Phase 2 rekeying is completed.   713171,   UDP-Encapsulated-Transport was either proposed or selected during Phase 2. Send this payload for NAT-Traversal in this case.   713172,   NAT-Traversal auto-detected NAT.   713174,"   A hardware client is attempting to tunnel in using network extension mode, but network extension mode is not allowed.   "713176,"   The ASA is processing data intended to trigger an IPsec tunnel to the indicated peer. Because memory resources are at a critical state, it is not initiating any more tunnels. The data packet has been ignored and dropped.   "713177,   A Phase 2 ID payload containing an FQDN has been received from the peer.   713178,   An internal software error has occurred.   713179,   An internal software error has occurred.   713182,   An internal software error has occurred.   713184,"   The client operating system and application version appear. If the information is not available, then N/A will be indicated.   "713185,"   The client returned an invalid length username, and the tunnel was torn down.   "713186,"   An invalid secondary domain name list was received from an external RADIUS authentication server. When split tunnelling is used, this list identifies the domains that the client should resolve through the tunnel.   "713187,   The IKE peer that is attempting to bring up this tunnel is not the one that is configured in the ISAKMP configuration that is bound to the received remote subnet.   713189,   The IP address from the pool is either the network or broadcast address for this subnet. This address will be marked as unavailable.   713190,   The reference counter for this SA is invalid.   713191,"   To minimize CPU-intensive cryptographic calculations, the ASA limits the number of connection negotiations in progress. When a new negotiation is requested and the ASA is already at its limit, the new negotiation is rejected. When an existing connection negotiation completes, new connection negotiation will again be permitted.  "713193,   The ASA received an encrypted or unencrypted packet of the specified exchange type that had one or more missing payloads. This usually indicates a problem on the peer.   713194,   A delete message with a termination reason code was received.   713195,"   The originate-only peer can accept incoming connections only after it brings up the first P2 tunnel. At that point, data from either direction can initiate additional Phase 2 tunnels.   "713196,"   The remote L2L peer has initiated a public-public tunnel. The remote L2L peer expects a response from the peer at the other end, but does not receive one, because of a possible misconfiguration.   "713197,   The configured confidence interval in the group is outside of the valid range.   713198,   A reason string that states that a username cannot be found in the certificate appears.   713199,   The Reaper corrected an internal software error.   713203,   An error occurred while reading a received IKE packet. This is generally an internal error and might indicate a software problem.   713204, This message indicates that a route to the peer-assigned address or to the networks protected by a hardware client was added to the routing table.  713205, An attempt to add a route to the client-assigned address or to the networks protected by a hardware client failed. This might indicate duplicate routes in the routing table or a corrupted network address. The duplicate routes might be caused by routes that were not cleaned up correctly or by having multiple clients sharing networks or addresses.  713206, A tunnel was dropped because the allowed tunnel specified in the group policy was different from the allowed tunnel in the tunnel group configuration.  713207,  This syslog is displayed for ikev1 while terminating the connection if GW is an initiator and tunnel group type is L2TP over IPSEC. 713208,"A failure occurred in creating the ACLs that trigger IKE and allow IPsec data to be processed properly. The failure was specific to the backup L2L configuration, which may indicate a configuration error, a capacity error, or an internal software error.  "713209,  A failure occurred in deleting the ACLs that trigger IKE and allow IPsec data to be processed correctly. The failure was specific to the backup L2L configuration. This may indicate an internal software error.  713210," A failure occurred in creating a run-time instance of the dynamic crypto map associated with backup L2L configuration. This may indicate a configuration error, a capacity error, or an internal software error.  "713211," The ASA is adding a route for the private address or networks of the peer. In this case, the peer is either a client or a L2L peer with an unknown address. Both of these cases use dynamic crypto maps to allow the tunnel.  "713212," The ASA failed while attempting to add a route for the private address or networks of the peer. In this case, the peer is either a client or a L2L peer with an unknown address. Both of these cases use dynamic crypto maps to allow the tunnel. This might indicate duplicate routes, a full routing table, or a failure of the ASA to remove previously used routes.  "713213," The ASA is deleting a route for the private address or networks of the peer. In this case, the peer is either a client or a L2L peer with an unknown address. Both of these cases use dynamic crypto maps to allow the tunnel.  "713214," The ASA experienced a failure while deleting a route for the private address or networks of the peer. In this case, the peer is either a client or a L2L peer with an unknown address. Both of these cases use dynamic crypto maps to allow the tunnel. The route may have already been deleted,or an internal software error has occurred.  "713215, The client type and the version of a client did not match any of the rules configured on the ASA. The default action appears.  713216, The client type and the version of a client have matched one of the rules. The results of the match and the rule are displayed.  713217, A malformed client type and version rule exist. The required format is action client type | client version action. Either permit or deny client type and client version are displayed under Session Management. Only one wildcard per parameter (*) is supported.  713218, The client was denied access according to the configured rules.713219, Phase 2 messages are being enqueued after Phase 1 completes.  713220, Queued Phase 2 messages are being processed.  713221, The ASA is iterating through the crypto maps looking for configuration information.  713222," While iterating through the configured crypto maps, the ASA cannot match any of the associated ACLs. This generally means that an ACL was misconfigured.  "713223, The crypto map associated with this peer is not linked to an ACL.  713224, The crypto map associated with this VPN tunnel is missing critical information.  713225, The ASA found a valid matching crypto map for this VPN tunnel.  713226," When the device is configured to use digital certificates, a trustpoint must be specified in the configuration. When the trustpoint is missing from the configuration, this message is generated to flag an error.  "713227," When establishing a Phase SA, the ASA will reject a new Phase 2 matching this proxy.  "713228, IKE obtained a private IP address for the client from DHCP or from the address pool.   713229, A VPN remote access client is notified that updated software is available for download. The remote client user is responsible for choosing to update the client access software.  713230," An internal error occurred, which is reporting that the IKE subsystem is attempting to lock memory that has already been locked. This indicates errors on semaphores that are used to protect memory violations for IKE SAs. This message does not indicate that anything is seriously wrong. However, an unexpected event has occurred, and steps are automatically being taken for recovery.  "713231," An internal error has occurred, which is reporting that the IKE subsystem is attempting to unlock memory that is not currently locked. This indicates errors on semaphores that are used to protect memory violations for IKE SAs. This message does not indicate that anything is seriously wrong. However, an unexpected event has occurred, and steps are automatically being taken for recovery.  "713232," All the IKE SA are locked, and a possible error has been detected. This message reports errors on semaphores that are used to protect memory violations for IKE SAs.  "713233," The remote network received during the Phase 2 negotiation was validated. The message indicates the results of the remote network check during Phase 2 negotiations for Network Extension Mode clients. This is part of an existing feature that prevents users from misconfiguring their hardware client network (for example, configuring overlapping networks or the same network on multiple clients).  "713234, The remote network received during the Phase 2 negotiation does not match the framed-ip-address and framed-subnet-mask that were returned from the AAA server for this session.  713235," Normally, IKE packets should never be sent from the standby unit to the remote peer. If such an attempt is made, an internal logic error may have occurred. The packet never leaves the standby unit because of protective code. This message facilitates debugging.  "713236, IKE sent or received various messages.  713237, The Phase 1 rekey of a remote access IPsec tunnel appears under the following conditions:   713238, The private side address of a network extension mode client came across as 0.0.0.0. This usually indicates that no IP address was set on the private interface of the hardware client.   713239, An attempt to create a tunnel has occurred after the maximum number of tunnels allowed has been reached.  713240, A Diffie-Hellman key with the incorrect length was received from the peer.  713241, An invalid proxy setting was found during ModeCfg processing. P1 negotiation will fail.  713242," The ASA has detected a request to start an IKE rekey for a tunnel configured to use Hybrid Xauth, but the rekey was not started. The ASA will wait for the client to detect and initiate an IKE rekey.  "713243," The IKE peer requested a certificate from the cert-req payload. However, no valid identity certificate issued by the requested DN was found.  "713244," The LAM attribute type received differs from the last type received. The type must be consistent throughout the user authentication process. The user authentication process cannot proceed, and the VPN connection will not be established.  "713245," An unsupported LAM type was received during the CRACK challenge or response user authentication process. The user authentication process cannot proceed, and the VPN connection will not be established.  "713246," The ASA received an unknown LAM attribute type, which should not cause connectivity problems, but might affect the functionality of the peer.  "713247, An unexpected error occurred during state processing.  713248," When an IKE SA is negotiated using the CRACK authentication method, the Phase 1 SA rekey timer at the headend expired before a successful rekey. Because the remote client is always the initiator of the exchange when using the CRACK authentication method, the headend will not initiate the rekey. Unless the remote peer initiates a successful rekey before the IKE SA expires, the connection will come down upon IKE SA expiration.  "713249," While negotiating an IKE SA using the CRACK authentication method, the IKE subsystem received a result that is not supported during CRACK authentication from the authentication subsystem. The user authentication fails, and the VPN connection is torn down.  "713250," The ASA received a request for an internal address attribute that is not recognizable. The attribute might be valid, but not currently supported, or the peer might be sending an illegal value. This should not cause connectivity problems, but might affect the functionality of the peer.  "713251, The ASA received a notification message that indicated an authentication failure while an IKE SA is negotiated using the CRACK authentication method. The connection is torn down.  713252," When the group policy is configured to require the client to authenticate with a Zonelab Integrity Server, the server might need to be connected to the concentrator depending on the failure policy configured. If the fail policy is to reject the client connection, this message is generated when a Zonelab Integrity Server is not connected to the ASA at the time the client is connecting.  "713253," When the group policy is configured to require a client to authenticate with a Zonelab Integrity Server, the server might need to be connected to the concentrator, depending on the failure policy configured. If the failure policy is to accept the client connection, and provide unrestricted network access, this message is generated when a Zonelab Integrity Server is not connected to the ASA at the time the client is connecting.  "713254," You cannot use UDP port 4500 for IPsec/UDP connections, because it is reserved for IPsec or NAT-T connections. The CLI does not allow this configuration for local groups. This message should only occur for externally defined groups.  "713255, An unknown tunnel group was specified in ISAKMP Aggressive Mode message 1.  713256," When the peer specifies an invalid tunnel group, the ASA will still send message 2 to prevent the peer from gleaning tunnel group information.  "713257," An ASA has acted as the responder in a LAN-to-LAN connection. It indicates that the ASA crypto configuration does not match the configuration of the initiator. The message specifies during which phase the mismatch occurred, and which attributes both the responder and the initiator had that were different.  "713258," The ASA tries to establish a Phase 2 tunnel on an interface, and a Phase 1 tunnel already exists on a different interface. The existing Phase 1 tunnel is torn down to allow the establishment of a new tunnel on the new interface.  "713259," The termination reason for the ISAKMP session appears, which occurs when the session is torn down through session management.  "713260," When trying to create a Phase 1 SA, the interface database could not be found for the interface ID.  "713261," When trying to create a Phase 1 SA, no IPv6 address is specified on the local interface.  "713262," When establishing a Phase SA, the ASA will reject a new Phase 2 SA matching this proxy.  "713263," The ASA is adding a route for the private address or networks of the peer.

"715051, An unknown TLV was received in an ASA record while an FWTYPE ModeCfg Reply was being processed. The TLV will be discarded. This might occur either because of packet corruption or because the connecting client supports a later version of the ASA protocol.  715052," The old P1 SA is being deleted, but has no new SA to transition to because it was marked for deletion as well. This generally indicates that the two IKE peers are out-of-sync with each other and may be using different rekey times. The problem should correct itself, but there may be some small amount of data loss until a fresh P1 SA is reestablished.  "715053, The ASA received a mode configuration message requesting the specified attribute.  715054, The ASA received a mode configuration reply message from the remote peer.  715055, The ASA sent a mode configuration message to the remote peer.  715056," Because the remote end (client) is configured for IPsec over TCP, the headend ASA must not negotiate IPsec over UDP or IPsec over NAT-T with the client.
